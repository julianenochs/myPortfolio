        I'm a software developer with a curious mind that is inspired by beautiful and accessible designs. As a yoga and meditation instructor, I learned the beauty in increasing efficiency
        while descreasing difficulty of execution. Simplicity is key in my work. I believe that through simple techniques we can vastly impact the world around us to become a more comfortable,
        accessible place for all people. My hope is to perpetuate a positive influence through my work, in the workplace and through a products mission. Let's make the world more beautiful together.
